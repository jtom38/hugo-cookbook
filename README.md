# Hugo Cookbook

![](images/social-preview.png)

Simple and minimal digital cookbook theme built for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

This tempalte is here to help people get started with a basic digital cookbook.  This was created due to finding old recipes that we loved, just disapear from the internet.  Due to that, I wanted to start to archive all the recipes we used.  So my personal digital cookbook, [Tombleson Family Cookbook](https://jtom38.github.io/cookbook) was created.

This template is still rough in some spots but currently in use!

This template is built with [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io) and runs with minimal javascript.  I wanted this to work well on a tablets and phones.

## Getting Started

Create a git submodules package to use this page.  Always pull from a release rather then what you find in master!  The master branch is unstable and could break your site.
